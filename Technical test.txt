Weather data technical test
===========================

Requirements
============
No external libraries, build steps or transpiled languages may be used - only native browser features.
No use of third party server APIs, e.g. no xhr/http calls - logic to be implemented in browser.
Should work on latest Chrome or Edge browser.
Access to internet allowed during task implementation.

Create an html page that allows a user to upload the supplied weather.dat file.

The page should then provide the following output:

Number of the day with the minimum temperature diference MnT.
Number of the day with the maximum temperature diference MxT.

You can assume that the file will be in the same fixed width format each month it is analysed.
Also assume that you may be asked for further information or new requirements in a fictional further development stage.
